# Smart Irrigation System using Cisco Packet Tracer

## Aim
To design a smart irrigation system that monitors water/soil levels and automatically controls sprinklers to ensure efficient water usage in agricultural fields.

## Result
The smart irrigation system was successfully simulated in Cisco Packet Tracer. The water level sensor controlled the sprinklers automatically based on defined conditions. This confirms efficient water usage through IoT-based automation.
